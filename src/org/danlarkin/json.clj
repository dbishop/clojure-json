  "Macro to add custom encoding behavior to the encoder.

   For example:

   (add-encoder java.util.Date

                  #^String pad #^String current-indent #^String start-token-indent #^Integer indent-size]
               (.append writer (str start-token-indent \" date \"))))

   The type hinting of parameters isn't required but it does seem to speed up performance a lot
   so I recommend using them.
